// Exercise 01
// Using a regex, get an array of the grade values e.g. Grade 1, Grade 2 ...
let reg1 = /Grade\s\d/g
console.log(ex1.match(reg1));

// Exercise 02
// Using a regex, determine whether the string contains the substring 'agenda' or 'age'
console.log(/age/.test(ex2));
// Exercise 03
// Using a regex, get an array of numbers that are contained in the string (removing any symbols)
console.log(ex3.match(/\d+/g))
// Exercise 04
// Using a regex, find out the name contained in the string (after the semicolon :)
console.log(ex4.match(/:\s+(\w+)/)[1])
// Exercise 05
// Using a regex, find the number of contractions used in the string.
console.log(ex5.match(/'[dstm]|'[r|ve]/g).length)
